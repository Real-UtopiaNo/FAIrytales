Leo was known for his love of nature, especially the birds that sang in the trees outside his cottage. One morning, as he sat by the window, a golden bird with shimmering feathers landed on the sill. Its song was unlike any Leo had ever heardâ€”melodic and filled with magic. The bird looked at Leo with wise, knowing eyes, as if it had a secret to share.",
